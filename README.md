# Drips/ Drops Infusion Calculator

Access to [Drips/ Drops Infusion Calculator](https://drip-drop-infusion-calculator-20a660d690cd.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose
Built to practise JavaScript create-react-apps. The theme was inspired from my time as a registered nurse when I was required to calcalute drips/ drops rates for intravenous infusions, usually for blood products such as platets which could not be put through a mechanical infussion pump because the platets get damaged via the pump mechanism.  This was an opportunity to incorpate a little math and my real world experience. 

Takes three user inputs, stores them as variables and uses them in the calculation to supply the correct answer. The input fields take only numbers and the "Answer" button can not be clicked unless all three inputs are supplied. After the answer is given the input fields are automatically cleared for the users convenicens. 

## Proud of
Did my own CSS and styling.
Confidence with display: flex;, and playing around with the opacity property.
